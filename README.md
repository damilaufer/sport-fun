# Run locally

Run from "Run and debug" (NextJs: debug full stack)

# Deploy

To deploy to production, just push to the "main" branch

Do not store the package-lock.json if you do `npm i` from PP. It will have the
PP registry (even when it shouldn't) and the deployment will fail.

# TypeScript Support

This project now supports TypeScript. To start using TypeScript:

1. Place your `.ts` or `.tsx` files in the `src` directory.
2. Run `npx tsc` to compile TypeScript files to JavaScript in the `dist`
   directory.
